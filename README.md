Example codes that shows how to use libelf to manipulate ELF objects for native and non-native architectures.

This tutorial introduces the libelf library being developed at the ElfToolChain
project on SourceForge.Net. It shows how this library can be used to create tools
that can manipulate ELF objects for native and non-native architectures.
The ELF(3)/GELF(3) APIs are discussed, as is handling of ar(1) archives.
The ELF format is discussed to the extent needed to understand the use of the
ELF(3) library.
Knowledge of the C programming language is a pre-requisite.
